# This is a list of pypi packages to be installed into virtualenv. Alternatively,
# you can install these as RPMs instead of pypi packages. Use
# `sudo dnf builddep resultsdb.spec`

# A note for maintainers: Please keep this list in sync with resultsdb.spec.
# You should require exact versions here (in order to define an exact working
# environment), and require a minimal version in the spec file (in order to allow
# the libraries to have some minor version bumps during the Fedora release
# lifecycle). If the Fedora libraries span multiple versions across releases,
# you can define a dependency range here instead of an exact version.

# This list is in the same order as the requirements in the specfile.

Flask == 0.10.1
iso8601 == 0.1.11
